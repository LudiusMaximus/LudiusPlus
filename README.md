# Ludius Plus

A collection of little WoW tweaks by Ludius that enhance your gameplay with quality-of-life improvements and convenient shortcuts.

## Features

### 🐎 Dismount/Mount Toggle
Bind a single hotkey to seamlessly switch between mounted and dismounted states. Perfect for fluid, uninterrupted combat transitions. Supports Druid Travel Forms and Dracthyr Soar. Optionally auto-switch your action bar when mounting to keep your abilities within reach.

### 🔦 Flashlight (Torch)
Toggle the Cave Spelunker's Torch on and off with a hotkey. Tired of manual toggling in dark caves and dungeons? Now your torch is just one keystroke away—always ready when you need it, gone when you don't.

### 🔇 Mute Sounds
Banish annoying sounds by their ID. Ever been bothered by repetitive summon sounds, ambient noise, or other audio distractions? Mute them individually while keeping all other game sounds intact. Fully customizable.

### ⚡ Dialog Skipper
Skip tedious confirmation dialogs automatically. Streamline your auctions, pet charm purchases, and item bindings. Set price limits for auction auto-confirm to prevent costly mistakes—peace of mind with every transaction.

### ⚔️ Persistent Unsheath
Automatically maintain your desired weapon sheath state. Choose to keep your weapons sheathed in town and automatically unsheath them in combat, or vice versa. Optional silent mode disables the sounds for seamless weapon state restoration.

### 🐾 Persistent Companion
Never lose your pet companion again. Automatically resummon your last active pet after it disappears—whether from flying, stepping through portals, or entering instances. Your trusted companion is always just a moment away.
