# Ludius Plus

A collection of little WoW tweaks by Ludius that enhance your gameplay with quality-of-life improvements and convenient shortcuts.

By default, all features are disabled. Type **/ldp** to get to the options fast.

## Features

### ⚡ Dialog Skipper
Skip tedious confirmation dialogs automatically. Streamline your auctions, pet charm purchases, and item bindings. Set price limits for auction auto-confirm to prevent costly mistakes.

### 🛒 Vendor Item Overlay
Enhance vendor browsing with additional item information overlays.
* **Ownership for decor items:** Displays ownership details for housing decor items — showing "[in storage]/[total owned]" in the top-right corner of each icon, so you can see at a glance how many you already own.
* **Already known items:** Greys out and marks items you already know (Toys, Mounts, Pets, Transmog, Recipes) with a checkmark, so you can see at a glance what you have already collected.

### 🔄 Spell Icon Overlay
Display an icon overlay on spells in your spellbook or action bars that are included in the single-button combat rotation. This visual indicator helps you identify at a glance which abilities are automated, so you can see which ones you still need to press manually while using the single-button assistant, or even which ones you want to keep off your action bars as they are automated.

### 🐎 Dismount/Mount Toggle
Bind a single hotkey to seamlessly switch between mounted and dismounted states. Perfect for fluid "death from above" combat transitions and landing maneuvers. Saves you one action bar click to re-mount. You can also assign Druid Travel Forms and Dracthyr Soar instead of a mount.

### 🏁 Race on Last Mount
Start Skyriding races on your preferred flying mount, not the default Renewed Proto-Drake. If you start a race unmounted, the addon automatically switches to your last active flying mount during the race countdown which saves you one action bar click.

### 🐾 Persistent Companion
Never lose your pet companion again. The addon is aware of when you actively summon or dismiss your companion battle pet and automatically persists this state. It resummons the pet after it disappears — e.g. from flying, stepping through portals, or entering instances. Your trusted companion is always just a moment away.

Additional features:
* **Dismiss pet while stealthed:** Nothing breaks immersion like your pet seemingly giving you away while you are stealthed (Rogue Stealth/Vanish, Druid Prowl, Hunter Camouflage, Mage Invisibility, Night Elf Shadowmeld, etc.). The addon can automatically dismiss your pet when entering stealth and resummon it when stealth ends.
* **Dismiss pet in combat:** Automatically dismiss your pet when entering combat and resummon it when combat ends. Ideal if you prefer a cleaner view during battles.


### ⚔️ Persistent Unsheath
The addon keeps track of when you actively sheathe or unsheathe and persists this state. It then automatically maintains your last desired weapon sheath state. For example, you never have to manually unsheathe your wand after a spell cast, if unsheathed is your preference, or you never have to manually sheathe your weapon after combat if sheathed is your preference.

### 🔇 Mute Sounds
Banish annoying sounds by their ID. Ever been bothered by repetitive summon sounds, ambient noise, or other audio distractions? Mute them individually while keeping all other game sounds intact.

### 🔦 Flashlight (Torch)
Toggle your Flashlight (Cave Spelunker's Torch) on and off "Half-Life-style" with a hotkey. Unfortunately, we cannot automatically restore the torch-on state, but the hotkey saves you an action bar click.
